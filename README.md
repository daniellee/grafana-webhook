# Webhook Notifier for Grafana Alerting

This is a simple implementation of a [webhook notifier](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/alerting-rules/manage-contact-points/webhook-notifier/) for Grafana alerting. When Grafana alerts, it sends a JSON payload to a webhook (if configured). This webhook will save them to an sqlite database.
